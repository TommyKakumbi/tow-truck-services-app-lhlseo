Include options for roadside assistance, accident recovery, and vehicle transport.\n-   **Profile Screen:** Enable users to manage their profile information, view past service requests, and store payment methods.\n\n**Design Elements:**\n\n-   **Colors:**\n    -   Background: `#F9F9F9` (Light gray for a clean look)\n    -   Text: `#212121` (Dark gray for readability)\n    -   TextSecondary: `#757575` (Medium gray for less important text)\n    -   Primary: `#2962FF` (Blue, representing reliability and trust)\n    -   Secondary: `#FFD600` (Yellow, for highlights and call-to-action buttons)\n    -   Accent: `#2962FF` (Same as primary, for consistency)\n    -   Card: `#FFFFFF` (White, for content containers)\n    -   Highlight: `#FFD600` (Same as secondary, for emphasis)\n-   **Typography:**\n    -   Use modern, clean fonts like \"Roboto\" or \"Open Sans\" for a professional and readable experience.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Modify the Home Screen:**\n    -   Read the content of `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx`.\n    -   Update the `HomeScreen` component to include a map view (using `react-native-maps` or a similar library) and display available towing services.\n    -   Add UI elements for displaying estimated arrival times.\n2.  **Create a Service Request Screen:**\n    -   Create a new file `app/request.tsx`.\n    -   Implement a form for users to input their location, vehicle type, and issue details.\n    -   Add options for different towing services (roadside assistance, accident recovery, etc.).\n3.  **Modify the Profile Screen:**\n    -   Read the content of `app/(tabs)/profile.tsx`.\n    -   Update the `ProfileScreen` component to allow users to manage their profile information.\n    -   Add functionality to view past service requests and store payment methods.\n4.  **Update Tab Layout:**\n    -   Read the content of `app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx`.\n    -   Modify the tab bar to include icons and labels for the Home, Request, and Profile screens.\n5.  **Remove Modal Demos:**\n    -   Read the content of `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx`.\n    -   Remove the `modalDemos` array from `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx`.\n\nNow, I will instruct the coding agent to implement the plan and modify the app/(tabs) folder to implement the changes and make the changes visible for the user. After the coding agent has implemented the plan, the modalDemos array from app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx should be removed.\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-10-19T09:52:57.387220"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you build a towing truck services app!
